This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Summary

In this project, you will create a user directory that matches the mockup provided. You will create this project from the ground up, including running `create-react-app` and building out the CSS and React components. The user data you will display has been provided for you in `data.js`. You won't receive much instruction on this project, but ask your mentors for help as often as needed.

## Example

![Example](https://github.com/DevMountain/react-i-ii-afternoon/blob/master/mockup.jpeg?raw=true)

## Requirements

Your project should...

- Use at least 3 different components, including at least 1 that holds and updates state.
- Allow users to navigate through all the user information from the array in `data.js` using the `< Previous` and `Next >` buttons. Include special handling for those buttons for the first and last users in the array to avoid errors.
- Display where in the array the current user is located (ex. 1/25)
- Match the layout and styling of the mockup as closely as possible.

\*Note: The `Edit`, `Delete` and `New` buttons are not required to get credit for this project. They are part of the Black Diamond if you finish the requirements early.

## Black Diamond

- After the `< Previous` and `Next >` buttons are functional, start working on `Delete`.
- After the `Delete` button is functional, start working on `New`. This will require a form for users to input new information. Focus on the functionality more than the styling.
- After the `New` button is functional, start working on `Edit`. This will also require a form for users to input updated information. Focus on the functionality more than the styling.
